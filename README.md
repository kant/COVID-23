This is a very little piece of code in [Python](https://www.python.org) to analyse trough plots
the data in the [2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by Johns
Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) by regions.

First of all you need to download the Johns Hopkins repository...

Then you need **Python 3** and this packages to use it:
- matplotlib

- numpy

You can plot cases' data (confirmed cases, deaths, recovered patients) by date or
since _n_ case appearance.
You can use linear or logarithmic scales.
You can group data by country or study states/province data.
You can plot death rate evolution too.
