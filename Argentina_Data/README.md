# Analysis and plotting of COVID-19 data

Here is the data from the [National Reports](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/coronavirus/informe-diario) published
in Argentina by the Ministry of Health. Is saved on a spreadsheet and then exported to a csv file.  
Note that the data is incomplete because these reports has some limitations:
- Data for confirmed cases are informed by district (same case for deaths)
- Data for recovered cases, laboratory tests and dropped cases are informed for all country.


### processed_data folder

You can access *processed_data* folder to see data extracted and processed data from *Argentina.csv*.

### actual_charts folder

In *actual_charts* folder I will save some charts to quickly visualize the most recent data.
